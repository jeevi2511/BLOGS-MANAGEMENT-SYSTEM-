# BLOGS-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-
The Blogs Management System is a desktop application built using Java Swing that allows users to create, edit, and view blog posts easily. It features a login page for secure access and a dashboard to manage blogs with details like title, description, and date.

This project demonstrates core Java Swing concepts such as GUI design, event handling, and file or database connectivity. It provides a simple, user-friendly platform to manage personal or group blogs efficiently, making it a practical example of applying object-oriented programming in desktop applications.
